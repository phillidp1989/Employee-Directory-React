## Description:
The application is an employee directory utilising React components to create the UI. When the application first loads, all employee data is rendered. The user then has the ability to filter by surname, search for a specific employee and to sort by either first or last name. 

## Visuals:

## Installation:
The application can be viewed at https://salty-escarpment-58993.herokuapp.com/. To run the development app, users can clone the folder onto their own computer by forking the repo in Github. All npm packages can be installed by running npm install in the terminal of the root directory. The development server can then be run by typing the command npm start.

## Usage:
The user can view all employee information when the appication loads. To view further information about each employee, the user must click on the specific card which will reveal more data. The list of employees can be filtered by the first letter of the surname. This feature can be accessed by clicking the first collapsible at the top of the page, which expands to show a button for each letter of the alphabet. When a letter is clicked, the list of employees will re-render showing only employees with a surname beginning with that letter. The second collapsible will display a search bar with auto complete functionality. When the user begins to type an employee's name, they will be presented with a list of suggested options and the list will dynamically update based on user input. Finally, radio buttons allow the user to sort the results by first or last name.
